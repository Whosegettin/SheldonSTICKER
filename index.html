      Magpie gossiping fills the cool autumn air as we descend on a backyard with all the trappings of Aussie suburbia:
      A trusty barbie. A slowly rusting mower. An ancient clothesline. 
      But, amidst this familiar snapshot lies—<br>
      A thriving realm—<br>
      A garden.

    <div class="sceneHeading">EXT. ATOP THE GARDEN’S BIRDBATH - THAT SAME MOMENT</div>
    <div class="bigPrint">
      Two snails stand sentinel. Drinking in the lightening garden before them. Their weather worn shells and wrinkled bodies reveal their age. 
      PERRYWINKLE (65) and WORDSWORTH (73) have stood here many times before. 
    </div>

    <div class="character">PERRYWINKLE</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Perhaps He does not beckon to us today Wordsworth.</div>

    <div class="character">WORDSWORTH</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Perhaps not Perrywinkle.</div>

    <div class="bigPrint">
      An answer. Perhaps an unwanted one. The snails begin their long winding descent, heavy with the burden of it. 
      As though sensing this weariness the heavens themselves yield in response. 
      A lone drop of water PLINKS in the birdbath rippling outwards. 
      The two snails halt.
    </div>

    <div class="character">PERRYWINKLE</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Or...perhaps He does.</div>

    <div class="bigPrint">Perrywinkle turns to Wordsworth forebodingly.</div>

    <div class="dialogue">Send out Leaves to the young Escargolytes at once Wordsworth.</div>

    <div class="bigPrint">
      He thrusts his arms out slowly. Wordsworth SIGHS with exasperation. 
      Ever the performer that old Perrywinkle.
