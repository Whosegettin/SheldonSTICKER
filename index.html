      Magpie gossiping fills the cool autumn air as we descend on a backyard with all the trappings of Aussie suburbia:  
      A trusty barbie. A slowly rusting mower. An ancient clothesline.  
      But, amidst this familiar snapshot lies—  
      A thriving realm—  
      A garden.

    <div class="sceneHeading">EXT. ATOP THE GARDEN’S BIRDBATH – THAT SAME MOMENT</div>
    <div class="action">
      Two snails stand sentinel. Drinking in the lightening garden before them. Their weather-worn shells and wrinkled bodies reveal their age.  
      PERRYWINKLE (65) and WORDSWORTH (73) have stood here many times before.

    <div class="character">PERRYWINKLE</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Perhaps He does not beckon to us today Wordsworth.</div>

    <div class="dialogue">Perhaps not Perrywinkle.</div>

    <div class="action">
      An answer. Perhaps an unwanted one. The snails begin their long winding descent, heavy with the burden of it.  
      As though sensing this weariness the heavens themselves yield in response.  
      A lone drop of water PLINKS in the birdbath rippling outwards.  
      The two snails halt.

    <div class="character">PERRYWINKLE</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Or… perhaps He does.</div>

    <div class="action">Perrywinkle turns to Wordsworth forebodingly.</div>

      He thrusts his arms out slowly. Wordsworth SIGHS with exasperation.  
      Ever the performer that old Perrywinkle.
