  <div class="page script-page">
    <div class="scene-heading">EXT. A BACKYARD – SUNRISE</div>
    <div class="action">Magpie gossiping fills the cool autumn air as we descend on a backyard with all the trappings of Aussie suburbia:</div>
    <div class="action">A trusty barbie. A slowly rusting mower. An ancient clothesline. But, amidst this familiar snapshot lies–</div>
    <div class="action">A thriving realm–</div>
    <div class="action">A garden.</div>
    <div class="scene-heading">EXT. ATOP THE GARDEN’S BIRDBATH – THAT SAME MOMENT</div>
    <div class="action">Two snails stand sentinel. Drinking in the lightening garden before them. Their weather worn shells and wrinkled bodies reveal their age. PERRYWINKLE (65) and WORDSWORTH (73) have stood here many times before.</div>
    <div class="character">PERRYWINKLE</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Perhaps He does not beckon to us today Wordsworth.</div>
    <div class="character">WORDSWORTH</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Perhaps not Perrywinkle.</div>
    <div class="action">An answer. Perhaps an unwanted one. The snails begin their long winding descent, heavy with the burden of it.</div>
    <div class="action">As though sensing this weariness the heavens themselves yield in response. A lone drop of water PLINKS in the birdbath rippling outwards.</div>
    <div class="action">The two snails halt.</div>
    <div class="character">PERRYWINKLE</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Or...perhaps He does.</div>
    <div class="action">Perrywinkle turns to Wordsworth forebodingly.</div>
    <div class="character">PERRYWINKLE (CONT’D)</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Send out Leaves to the young Escargolytes at once Wordsworth.</div>
    <div class="action">He thrusts his arms out slowly. Wordsworth SIGHS with exasperation. Ever the performer that old Perrywinkle.</div>
    <div class="character">PERRYWINKLE (CONT’D)</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Today another Crossing thus begins.</div>
    <div class="action">The garden itself seems to hold its breath.</div>
    <div class="music-cue">MUSIC CUE: GREAT SOUTHERN LAND by ICEHOUSE</div>

    <div class="action">Then, like a pin drop-</div>
    <div class="scene-heading">EXT. SHELLHAVEN - MORNING</div>
    <div class="action">Autumn Leaves fall over the sprawling city of Shellhaven. A thriving metropolis nestled safely within the ordered confines of the garden.</div>
    <div class="action">PLINK. A lone Leaf is struck off course by a raindrop. It diverges from the rest, as though guided by fate. Or perhaps just the wind.</div>

    <div class="scene-heading">EXT. SHELL WASH - MORNING</div>
    <div class="action">The Leaf whirls over a busy Shell Wash where snails queue on conveyer belts that glisten with slime. Their shells are scrubbed and polished to a dazzling shine as they are rolled through banksia buffers.</div>
  
    <div class="scene-heading">EXT. COFFEE CART - MORNING</div>
    <div class="action">The Leaf blows past a streetside cart. Suited snails queue for their morning cup of Mulch. They flick through ‘The Daily Slime’ in synchronisation. A few glance upwards as the Leaf whistles past their antennae.</div>
 
    <div class="scene-heading">EXT. SNAIL MAIL ROUTE - MORNING</div>
    <div class="action">The Leaf narrowly avoids a SNAIL MAIL EMPLOYEE pulling a cart overloaded with leaf-wrapped parcels. The cart swerves hitting a bump, spilling envelopes everywhere.</div>
    <div class="character">SNAIL MAIL EMPLOYEE</div>
    <div class="dialogue">What in the name of Slog-!</div>
    <div class="action">Spotting The Leaf, he removes his hat, holding it dear to his chest.</div>
    <div class="character">SNAIL MAIL EMPLOYEE (CONT’D)</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Praise be.</div>

    <div class="scene-heading">EXT. SLIMEWAY - MORNING</div>
    <div class="action">The Leaf weaves in and out of the packed traffic. Snails grumble at the red light ahead. The Leaf is the only thing moving with any pace at peak hour.</div>

    <div class="scene-heading">EXT. STREET CROSSING - MORNING</div>
    <div class="action">Two absolute grommets: GOTE (15) and GARLEY (15) slide across the road, barkboards strapped atop their shells. They're oblivious to the impatient slimeway riders.</div>
    <div class="character">GARLEY</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Duuude, the pond waves are gonna be wicked right before that storm hits.</div>
    <div class="character">GOTE</div>
    <div class="dialogue">It's gonna be gnarly Garley</div>
    <div class="action">Garley and Gote rise up on their tails and bodyslam their slimey bellies, sending the Leaf careening off once more in a wicked tumble.</div>

    <div class="scene-heading">EXT. CARNIVAL GROUNDS - MORNING</div>
    <div class="action">The Leaf skirts over a large field.</div>
    <div class="action">Marquees are being raised. Lines drawn for a race track. Wheelbarrows cart in food and other goods. Snails working around the clock to pull together a big event.</div>

    <div class="scene-heading">EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - MORNING</div>
    <div class="action">The Leaf is drawn further from the city. At the outer edge of the garden the houses and other buildings become sparser.</div>
    <div class="action">Tucked behind a Bird's nest fern lies a patchwork of bark, old and new, coddled into a cosy home. The Leaf comes to rest at it's front door.</div>
    <div class="action">Music drifts from an upstairs window where the curtains are drawn back, welcoming us into-</div>

    <div class="scene-heading">EXT. A BEDROOM - MORNING</div>
    <div class="action">A messy teen's sanctuary. Dead flowers and ounk rock band posters (Slink-180-Goo, Slime Chemical Romance) adorn the walls.</div>
    <div class="action">GREAT SOUTHERN LAND plays on the radio.</div>
    <div class="action">Amoungst this vortex of teenage angst-</div>
    <div class="action">A shell. Uncanny in it's beauty. A mesmerising image. But only an image.</div>
    <div class="action">Poised before the shell, reflected in a mirror: SHELDON (16), a gallant, young gastropod.</div>
    <div class="action">He lingers a moment too long. Sheldon's expression is hard to read, but it's certainly not one of hubris. We're intruding on a private moment; Prying beneath the Shell.</div>
