    <div class="scene-heading">EXT. A BACKYARD – SUNRISE</div>
    <div class="action">Magpie gossiping fills the cool autumn air as we descend on a backyard with all the trappings of Aussie suburbia:</div>
    <div class="action">A trusty barbie. A slowly rusting mower. An ancient clothesline. But, amidst this familiar snapshot lies–</div>
    <div class="action">A thriving realm–</div>
    <div class="action">A garden.</div>
    <div class="scene-heading">EXT. ATOP THE GARDEN’S BIRDBATH – THAT SAME MOMENT</div>
    <div class="action">Two snails stand sentinel. Drinking in the lightening garden before them. Their weather worn shells and wrinkled bodies reveal their age. PERRYWINKLE (65) and WORDSWORTH (73) have stood here many times before.</div>
    <div class="character">PERRYWINKLE</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Perhaps He does not beckon to us today Wordsworth.</div>
    <div class="character">WORDSWORTH</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Perhaps not Perrywinkle.</div>
    <div class="action">An answer. Perhaps an unwanted one. The snails begin their long winding descent, heavy with the burden of it.</div>
    <div class="action">As though sensing this weariness the heavens themselves yield in response. A lone drop of water PLINKS in the birdbath rippling outwards.</div>
    <div class="action">The two snails halt.</div>
    <div class="character">PERRYWINKLE</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Or...perhaps He does.</div>
    <div class="action">Perrywinkle turns to Wordsworth forebodingly.</div>
    <div class="character">PERRYWINKLE (CONT’D)</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Send out Leaves to the young Escargolytes at once Wordsworth.</div>
    <div class="action">He thrusts his arms out slowly. Wordsworth SIGHS with exasperation. Ever the performer that old Perrywinkle.</div>

    <div class="dialogue">Today another Crossing thus begins.</div>
    <div class="action">The garden itself seems to hold its breath.</div>

    <div class="action">Then, like a pin drop-</div>
    <div class="scene-heading">EXT. SHELLHAVEN - MORNING</div>
    <div class="action">Autumn Leaves fall over the sprawling city of Shellhaven. A thriving metropolis nestled safely within the ordered confines of the garden.</div>
    <div class="action">PLINK. A lone Leaf is struck off course by a raindrop. It diverges from the rest, as though guided by fate. Or perhaps just the wind.</div>

  <!-- Page 4 of the script preview -->
  <div class="page script-page">
    <div class="scene-heading">EXT. SHELL WASH - MORNING</div>
    <div class="action">The Leaf whirls over a busy Shell Wash where snails queue on conveyer belts that glisten with slime. Their shells are scrubbed and polished to a dazzling shine as they are rolled through banksia buffers.</div>

  <div class="page script-page">
    <div class="scene-heading">EXT. COFFEE CART - MORNING</div>
    <div class="action">The Leaf blows past a streetside cart. Suited snails queue for their morning cup of Mulch. They flick through ‘The Daily Slime’ in synchronisation. A few glance upwards as the Leaf whistles past their antennae.</div>
  </div>


  <!-- Page 6 of the script preview -->
  <div class="page script-page">
    <div class="scene-heading">EXT. SNAIL MAIL ROUTE - MORNING</div>
    <div class="action">The Leaf narrowly avoids a SNAIL MAIL EMPLOYEE pulling a cart overloaded with leaf-wrapped parcels. The cart swerves hitting a bump, spilling envelopes everywhere.</div>
